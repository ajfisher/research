# Example Research Task

> **Note**: This is a template demonstrating the final README.md report that should be created at the end of your investigation. See `notes.md` for the working notes kept during the research process.

## Objective
This is an example research task directory structure to demonstrate how autonomous agents should organize their work and document their findings.

## Background
This example shows the recommended structure for self-contained research tasks in this repository.

## Methodology
1. Create dedicated directory with descriptive name
2. Organize code, data, and results in separate subdirectories
3. Document all aspects of the research
4. Keep work reproducible and self-contained

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Example for Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example for Node.js projects
npm install
```

## Dependencies
- List all dependencies here
- Or include in requirements.txt, package.json, etc.

## Usage

```bash
# Example command to run the research
python code/main.py

# Or for Node.js
node code/main.js
```

## Directory Structure

```
example-research-task/
├── README.md              # This file - final report created at end
├── notes.md              # Working notes kept throughout research
├── code/                  # Source code and scripts
├── data/                  # Data files
│   ├── raw/              # Original, unmodified data
│   └── processed/        # Cleaned or transformed data
└── results/              # Outputs and findings
    ├── figures/          # Charts, graphs, visualizations
    └── reports/          # Analysis reports and summaries
```

## Results
Results will be stored in the `results/` directory:
- `results/figures/` - Visualizations and plots
- `results/reports/` - Written analyses and summaries

## Conclusions
Summary of key findings and insights.

## Future Work
Potential extensions or follow-up research directions.

## Notes
- This is a template/example - actual research tasks should replace this content
- Start by creating `notes.md` and tracking your work as you go
- Create this `README.md` at the end as a final report
- Keep all work self-contained within this directory
- Commit only relevant files (no full repos, large binaries, or build artifacts)
- See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for complete workflow guidelines
